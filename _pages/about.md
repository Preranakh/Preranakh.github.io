Graduate Research and Teaching Assisstant, <br>
[University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu), Newark, Delaware


I am a second-year Ph.D. student CIS department and an HCI researcher at the University of Delaware, conducting research under [Prof.Matthew Maureillo](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mlm/) at [Sensify Lab](https://sensifylab.cis.udel.edu/) on the Community Comms Project. In our project, “Community Comms”, we are developing a Chrome browser plugin capable of logging a user’s browsing data, storing media annotations, and displaying information about news media bias using existing datasets. Expected contributions from this project include an examination of user perceptions of current challenges and benefits of existing online news media dissemination systems and design guidelines for implementing privacy-preserving, and transparent browsing experience interventions.

I am very much passionate doing HCI research using multiple methodologies with my critical thinking, problem-solving, and software engineering skillsets that can improve users' experiences. I want to utilize my User Experience Research expertise and specialty in Machine Learning & Natural language Processing and Data Analytics to bridge the gap between users’ needs and technology.

**Research Interests or Area**: Human Computer Interaction(HCI), Misinformation, Interventions and Natural Language Processing.
