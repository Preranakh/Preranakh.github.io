Graduate Research and Teaching Assisstant, <br>
[University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu), Newark, Delaware


I am a forth-year Ph.D. student CIS department and an HCI researcher at the University of Delaware, conducting research under [Prof.Matthew Maureillo](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mlm/) at [Sensify Lab](https://sensifylab.cis.udel.edu/) on the Community Comms Project.

Currently, I am leading the Community Comms project, which aims to develop a Chrome browser plugin that improves users' awareness of news media bias and supports media literacy. This plugin logs users’ browsing data, allows media annotations, and presents insights about news bias using existing datasets. The project explores user perceptions of challenges and benefits in current online news dissemination systems, ultimately contributing design guidelines for creating privacy-preserving, transparent, and user-centric browsing interventions.

My work leverages my expertise in Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Data Analytics to bridge the gap between users’ needs and technological solutions. I use mixed-methods research approaches to investigate technology-mediated behavior change, online misinformation, and community-driven content evaluation systems. My academic and professional interests span online news article evaluation, personal informatics tools, privacy-focused interventions, interaction design, and Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs). I am particularly passionate about designing crowdsourcing tools and intervention strategies that combat online misinformation and promote critical media consumption.

**Research Interests or Area**: Human Computer Interaction(HCI), Misinformation, Interventions and Natural Language Processing.

## Background
I was born in a small town in the Terai region of Nepal, and looking back, I feel incredibly grateful for the journey that has brought me to where I am today. My parents have been my greatest inspiration, shaping me into the person I am with their unwavering support and love.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Nepal, a place that holds so many beautiful memories of family, laughter, and discovery. Before moving to the U.S. for graduate studies, I spent two years working in the IT industry, specializing in data warehousing and business intelligence. That experience gave me a deep appreciation for data-driven insights and problem-solving, but more than anything, it fueled my passion for technology and its impact on people's lives.

Curiosity has always been my guiding force, leading me to explore new ideas and interdisciplinary research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and data science. My academic and professional journey has been shaped by the desire to create meaningful, user-centered technologies that can make a difference.

Beyond work and research, I find so much joy in the little things—cooking is my therapy, where I can slow down and create something with love. I have a deep love for traveling, capturing moments through photography and video editing, and bringing stories to life through content creation. Sketching is another way I express myself, letting my imagination flow onto paper.

Fun fact about me? I’m always rushing somewhere and forever a fast-facing expert—I like to keep life exciting and full of adventure!
