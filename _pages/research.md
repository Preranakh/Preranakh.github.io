**Current work:**

Misinformation and lack of trust in the media is an increasing problem online. While fact checking by service providers can be effective at mitigating misinformation, poor implementation can result in degrading trust in news systems. In this Project we are developing crowdsourcing and intervention tools that help to aggregate data about news articles and power community-driven review systems. The long-term aim is to explore recommendation algorithms and how interventions in browsing patterns might improve media literacy.

The reason behind the realization of misinformation as the burning issue and identifying it as a problem statement is the recent spike in political polarization fueled by the spread of misinformation online which has undermined our ability to find solutions to urgent problems in a democratic way. So to combat and identify misinformation and make people aware of their reading and browsing habits, we are developing intervention tools in fighting against fake news and misinformation.

My research works and projects include:

-Designing In-Situ Misinformation Interventions Using LLMs:
-Adaptive User-Centered Tools for Media Literacy:
-Mixed-Methods UX Research for Misinformation Detection:
-User Experience Design for Adaptive Interfaces:
-Usability Evaluation & Design System Enhancement:
-Interactive Visualizations for Real-Time Insights:
-Security and Privacy-Preserving Interventions:
