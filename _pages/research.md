**Current work:**

Misinformation and lack of trust in the media is an increasing problem online. While fact checking by service providers can be effective at mitigating misinformation, poor implementation can result in degrading trust in news systems. In this Project we are developing crowdsourcing and intervention tools that help to aggregate data about news articles and power community-driven review systems. The long-term aim is to explore recommendation algorithms and how interventions in browsing patterns might improve media literacy.

The reason behind the realization of misinformation as the burning issue and identifying it as a problem statement is the recent spike in political polarization fueled by the spread of misinformation online which has undermined our ability to find solutions to urgent problems in a democratic way. So to combat and identify misinformation and make people aware of their reading and browsing habits, we are developing intervention tools in fighting against fake news and misinformation.

My research works and projects include:

- Developing Crowdsourcing and intervention tool/prototype(Chrome Plugin) capable of logging a userâ€™s browsing
data, storing media annotations, and displaying information about news media bias using existing datasets.
- Background in qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method UX research methods, Knowledge of wireframe tools
e.g. Figma.
- Developing personas and usage scenarios.
- Preparing low-fidelity prototypes of UI (ranging from paper-and-pencil concepts to wireframes or prototypes) to
high-fidelity designs/ mockups of UI, and high-fidelity visuals for the features.
- Participating in User Experience Design activities such as Usability Testing, Semi Structured Interviews with
respect to online experiences with misinformation, Surveys, observation.
- Conducting usability evaluations and providing recommendations on how to improve our designs, Helping to
extend and maintain our design system.
- Integrate Firebase Authentication and Firebase Security Rules, Work on developing personalized visualizations
and informatics dashboards using D3.js.
- Developed a toolbar that provides the user with information about the political leaning and fact-based reporting
of a given news source.
