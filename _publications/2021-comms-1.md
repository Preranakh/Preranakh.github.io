## Abstract:
In this workshop paper, we propose developing a mixed-initiative, crowd-powered system to (i) semi-automatically
explore definitions of fake news online, (ii) curate datasets of new stories for machine learning applications, (iii) power-based tools that identify misinformation content in-situ, and (iv) deploy digital media literacy interventions and news recommendations that increase a user’s hardiness against misinformation threats on online news media platforms. Our objective here is to stimulate discussion around our prototype’s design, new mitigation approaches, and their applications.
